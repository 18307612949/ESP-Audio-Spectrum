#ESP8266 Audio Spectrum Display

This is a fun project.

A ESP8266 module is connected to a 8x8 LED Matrix.
A client program (webpage) accepts an audio file, decodes it and sends audio spectrum to ESP8266 for display.

The firmware is based on

 - websocketd by morrissinger
 - WS2812/I2S by Charles Lohr
